# env0 Extension for Visual Studio Code

Unleash the power of env0 directly from your Visual Studio Code workspace! The env0 extension allows seamless interaction with your env0 environments, making your development process smoother and more efficient.

## 🌟 Features

### 🌲 View Environments
- Easily access all environments related to the current branch you are working on.

### 🚀 Execute Actions
- Perform various actions such as `Deploy`, `Destroy`, `Cancel`, and `Abort` without leaving your IDE.

### 📜 Real-time Logs
- Once an environment is selected, view the most recent deployment logs in the env0 output channel.

### 🛎 Notifications
- Stay informed with real-time notifications regarding changing environment statuses and pending approvals.


## 📋 Requirements

Before using this extension, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. **env0 Organization**: You must have an existing env0 organization.
2. **API Credentials**: Provide the API Key ID and API Key Secret during login.

🔗 Learn how to [generate API keys](https://docs.env0.com/docs/api-keys).

## 🔑 Login and Logout

To login or logout, simply use the `env0.login` and `env0.logout` commands through the VS Code command palette.

## 🚧 Limitations

**API Key & Organizations**: If you're using a personal API key and your account is associated with multiple organizations, the extension will default to a single organization and won't provide an option to select others. Use an Organization API key to resolve this.

## 🛠 Setting Up Your Development Environment

1️⃣  Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2️⃣  Run `pnpm install` to install the required dependencies.  
3️⃣  Navigate to the Debug panel, accessible via the shortcut `CMD+SHIFT+D`.  
4️⃣  From the `RUN AND DEBUG` dropdown menu, select `Run Extension`.  
5️⃣  If a warning dialog appears, proceed by clicking `Debug Anyway`.

🚀 A new VS Code window will now launch, serving as your testing ground for the extension.

### 🎯 Quick Tips for Development

To refresh your debug window without closing it:  
1️⃣  Press `CMD+SHIFT+P` to open the command palette.  
2️⃣  Type `reload` in the search bar.  
3️⃣  Press Enter to execute.

⚠️ **Note**: Some modifications may necessitate the complete closure of the Debugging IDE.

## 🧪 Testing

### 🔄 Integration Testing

#### Running the Tests

Execute the following command in your terminal to run the integration tests:
```bash
pnpm run test
```

#### Debugging

For debugging, go to the "Run and Debug" panel in VS Code and select "Extension Test."

#### Technologies Used

- [**@vscode/test-electron**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/test-electron): To launch the tests in the VS Code process.
- [**Mocha**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha): Utilized as the test runner.
- [**Expect**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect): Used for assertions.
- [**Jest-Mock**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock): For mocking, stubbing, and spying on functions.
- [**MSW**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock): For HTTP mocking.

#### 🛠 Testing Adaptations

The VS Code API presents some unique challenges, such as not being able to read the content of notification messages or the VS Code output channel. To navigate these challenges, we use jest-mock to stub these functions, allowing us to verify that our code is behaving correctly during tests.

Moreover, we import the compiled dist extension file into our test setup. This enables us to run specific functions that are part of the extension, such as resetting its state after each test or ensuring that the Tree View displays the appropriate messages.
